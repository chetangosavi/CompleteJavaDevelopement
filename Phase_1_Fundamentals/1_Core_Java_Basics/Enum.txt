Enumeration: Enum
    In Java, an enum (short for enumeration) is a special data type used to define a collection of constants. 
    It is a way to define a set of named values that remain unchanged throughout the program.

    Key Features of Enum in Java:
        > Fixed set of constants – An enum defines a fixed number of values.
        > Type-Safe – Enums provide compile-time checking, preventing invalid values.
        > Can have methods and fields – Unlike simple constants, enums can contain instance variables, constructors, and methods.
        > Implicitly extends java.lang.Enum – Enums cannot extend other classes but can implement interfaces.
        > Can be used in switch statements – Enums work well with switch cases.
    
    Example :
            enum Day {
            SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY
            }

            public class EnumExample {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    Day today = Day.WEDNESDAY;
                    System.out.println("Today is: " + today);
                }
            }
