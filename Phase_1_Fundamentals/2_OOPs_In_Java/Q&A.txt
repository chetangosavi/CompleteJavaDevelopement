1> Why Can't We Override Static Methods in Java?
->  Static methods belong to the class, not to an instance (object). Method overriding is based on 
    runtime polymorphism (dynamic method dispatch), which works with instances of classes, not classes themselves. 
    Since static methods are resolved at compile-time and not based on the object type, they cannot be overridden.
