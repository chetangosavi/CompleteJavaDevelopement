Introduction To Collections in Java : 
    + There are three basic types of Collections in java:
        - Collections allows us to grow shrink and rearange data efficiently;

        1> Lists
        2> Map
        3> Sets 

    + Basic difference between collection and Array :
        - Collections does not allow storing of primitive type but only an Object <Generics>

    + List :
        - List is Sequence of objects that can shrink and grow
        - making it flexible for various Programming needed

        1> ArrayList:
                - same as array but comes with some built in methods
                - can grow and shrink dynamically

        2> Stack:
                - Works on LIFO : last in first out principle
                - methods used like push, pop, peak
        
        3> LinkedList :
                - chain of item linked together
                - ideal for managing ordered collection of data


    + Map :
        - are collection of key value pair, where each key is used to find corresponding value / object
        - can contain duplicates

        1> HashMap : 
            - converts keys into unordered hash values for fast lookups

        2> LinkedHashMap :
            - just like hashmap but objects are ordered by insertion 

        3> TreeMap :
            - treemaps are naturally ordered

    + Sets :

        1> HashSet :
            - has unique key value pairs with no duplicate Elements

        2> LinkedHashSet :
            - Contains unique insertion ordered elements its just like hash set accept ordering of elements 
              (order of element stays in the same manner as they are inserted)

        3> TreeSet :
            - TreeSet are naturally ordered



    NOTE :

            - lists are great for managing ordered Sequences of element
            - Map are great for storing and retriving data using key value pairs 
            - Sets are great for storing data where no duplicate element are allowed


    METHODS :

        LIST : 

                add(Object obj)  -> appends an element into list
                size() -> returns size of list
                clear(Object obj) -> removes all the objects from list
                remove(Object obj) -> removes the first occurance of object
                get(index) -> returns element at specific index

            + when we do not use generics while initialising arraylist it by default returns obj of Object class.
                Ex :

                        ArrayList arrList = new ArrayList();
                        Object obj = arrList.get(1);   --> Returns Object Type 
                        String str = (String)obj;    --> Casting to String Type(only works when you know the type)
                                    \
                                    might throw classCastException

                            To Solve this problem java introduced generics 

    + Generics in Java : Generic ensures type safety in Collections

        <> -> Generic Designator
        Ex :

            ArrayList<String>  list = new ArrayList<>();

        Primitive Types         ------     Generics(object)
            int                              Integer
            double                           Double
            String                           String

    Note :

        - Eliminates TypeCasting
        - reduce errors
        - reuseablity and clear code(Readability)
