LinkedList :

    what is LinkedList ?
    -> LinkedList arranges data into sequenc similar to stations along the train root
    - LinkedList is made up of nodes and ther connection 
    - flexible data Management
    - easy manipulation 
    - maintains intigrity
    ___________              _____________
    |  node 1 | -----------  |   node2   |
    |_________|              |___________|

    Node :   __________________
            | Value  | address |    
            |________|_________|

    + A linked list is a data structure that allows you to store a sequence of elements called nodes. 
      Each node holds two critical pieces of information: the data itself and a reference (or link) to 
      the next node in the sequence. This setup forms a chain-like structure, where each node knows how to 
      find the next one.

    + When to use linkedlist vs arraylist:
		 
		 	ArrayList - when retrival of data is priority rather than just insertion and deletion
		 	else use LinkedList
		 	
		+ Syntax to create linkedlist:
                LinkedList li = new LinkedList(); --> Custome
		 		LinkedList<Integer> li = new LinkedList<>();
