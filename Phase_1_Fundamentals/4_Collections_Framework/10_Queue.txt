Queue :

    FIFO -  First In First Out
    - Follows fifo principle

    Practical application of queue :
        - CPU scheduling
        - Handling I/O request
        - printer spoling
        - networking


    Queue Working :

    task 1 ---\
    task 2 ---| ----> | Queue | --  task 3, task 2, task1 --> CPU
    task 3 ---/

    Queue -
        - Linear DataStructure that stores data in ordered sequence
        - element are added at back and remove from front
        - ideal for asynchronous data, cpu scheduling
        - operation 
            enqueue() -> add element at rear position(back)
            dequeue() -> remove element from front
            peek() -> check whats at top without disturbing sequence
