    Exploring creating Stack : with the help of stack class

        - stack class is present in java.util package

        //importing stack class

        import java.util.Stack

    //creating object of stack class

        Stack<Integer> st = new Stack<>();

        // You can create stacks for other data types as well
        Stack<String> stringStack = new Stack<>();
        Stack<Double> doubleStack = new Stack<>();

        This creates a stack, but to add elements to it, you need to use the push() operation. Letâ€™s dig into this operation next.
