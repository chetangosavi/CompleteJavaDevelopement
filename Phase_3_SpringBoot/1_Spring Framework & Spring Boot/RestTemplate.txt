RestTemplate: 

        @> What is RestTemplate in Spring Boot?
        ->  RestTemplate is a synchronous HTTP client in Spring that allows your application to make HTTP 
            requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to RESTful web services.

        1> Pojo for response : 
        2> Instance in main : ProjectName.class
                @Bean
                public RestTemplate restTemplate() {
                    return new RestTemplate();
                }

        3> RestTemplate in Service class:

                ResponseEntity<WeatherResponse> response  = restTemplate.exchange(finalAPI, HttpMethod.GET,null, WeatherResponse.class );
		        WeatherResponse body = response.getBody();

                  - finalAPI -> final API String
                  - HttpMethod -> sending method Type
                  - null
                  - WeatherResponse -> class to convert response into (Deserialization)

        Why is RestTemplate Deprecated?
        ->  Spring recommends using WebClient (from spring-webflux) instead of RestTemplate, because:
                > RestTemplate is blocking (synchronous) → Slower performance for concurrent requests
                > WebClient is non-blocking (asynchronous) → Better for reactive applications.
            - But if you are using Spring Boot with synchronous APIs, RestTemplate is still fine.
