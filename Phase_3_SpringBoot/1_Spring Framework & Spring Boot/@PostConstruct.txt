@PostContruct Annotation: This is Like useEffect() in React

        The @PostConstruct annotation is used in Spring Boot to indicate that a method should run after 
        dependency injection is complete but before the class is used.

    When to Use @PostConstruct?
        > When you need to initialize resources after all dependencies are injected.
        > When you want to run startup logic only once.
        > When you need to preload data from a database or an API.

    Important Notes
        Runs only once after bean creation.
        Does not run if the bean is not used.
        @PostConstruct is part of jakarta.annotation (Spring Boot 3+).
