What is a @Bean in Spring?
    + A @Bean is an object that Spring manages for you, like a reusable component you can use anywhere in your project.


Think of it like:
    + "Hey Spring, please create this object only once and make it available wherever I need it."

    Ex:
        @Configuration
        public class AppConfig {

            @Bean
            public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
                return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
            }
        }

        What’s happening here?
        ->  When your app starts, Spring will call passwordEncoder() and store that BCryptPasswordEncoder object.
            Then you can @Autowired it wherever you want and use it.

What is @Component in Spring?
    + @Component is an annotation that tells Spring:
    ->"Hey Spring, this is a class you should manage, create an object of it, and make it available for @Autowired wherever needed."

    In simple terms:
        @Bean → Used on methods to create a managed object
        @Component → Used on classes to automatically detect and manage them
